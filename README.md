# What this is?
Using the old CPU core, I extend SheepShaver, so that it maye run some newe stuff & on newe computers.  Design I it for Mac OS X intel, reletively recent versions.  Open up SheepShaver_Xcode8 Xcode Project in the SheepShaver/src/MacOSX/ directory, & sacrifice some small code animals, & pray for luck, & mayebee you can compile & run it(it isn't quite building yet).
